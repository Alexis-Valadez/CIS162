    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Alexis Valadez, a student at Cerritos College. 
I currently work as a full-time restaurant supervisor at Norms, 
while I focus on my career goal in computer programming in hopes
of one day working from anywhere in the world. I have always loved
technology and its unlimited pontential in enriching the human 
experience. I am a huge sci-fi nerd and love how technology is always
thinning the line between science fiction and reality. I also would like 
to apply this goal to increase my ability to travel, explore, and soak in
the different cultures and experiences other regions of this planet have to 
offer.</p>

<h3>When I have free time</h3>
<ol>  
    <li>I love to spend time with friends and family!</li>
    <li>I like to partake in physical activities like hiking, exercising, sports.</li>
    <li>I love to explore new places!</li>
</ol> 

<p>One of my favorite websites is <a href="https://www.YouTube.com">YouTube</a> 
because of the amount of unlimited tutorials and resources to learn just about 
anything.</p>
